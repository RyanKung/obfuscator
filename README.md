# How to Build :

From : http://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html#developing-llvm-passes-out-of-source

When you are done developing your pass, you may wish to integrate it into the LLVM source tree. You can achieve it in two easy steps:

*    Copying <pass name> folder into <LLVM root>/lib/Transform directory.
*    Adding add_subdirectory(<pass name>) line into <LLVM root>/lib/Transform/CMakeLists.txt.


### Special case for macOS & Xcode

From : https://afnan.io/2018-10-01/using-the-latest-llvm-release-on-macos/

```
cmake -G Ninja \
  -DLLDB_CODESIGN_IDENTITY='' \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
  -DLLVM_CREATE_XCODE_TOOLCHAIN=On \
  -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  ../obfuscator-llvm-9.0.0.src
ninja -j5
```

I also recommend using `Ninja` rather than  `make` to build LLVM, because it will build significantly faster.

Now that you have the XCode toolchain, you can place it in the Toolchains directory in XCode.

```
sudo ninja install-xcode-toolchain
```

The toolchain is generated and installed in `/usr/local/Toolchains/LLVM9.0.0.xctoolchain`

You need to instruct XCode to actually use the toolchain. You can do so in two ways: from your environment variables, and through the XCode app itself.

To set it through an environment variable:

```
export TOOLCHAINS="LLVM9.0.0"
```

In Xcode.app, you can select `Xcode -> Toolchains -> org.llvm.9.0.0` in the menu.
